This is a standard attentive sequence to sequence model.
It is used for automatic text summarization. On Facebook's Gigaword dataset, it achives 42 Rouge-F1
score, beating the state-of-the-art (36), as of June 2016.

It is a fairly standard model consists of 3 parts:
1. Encoder sequence: Encoding the article inputs.
2. Attention: Pay attention to part of the encoding inputs, i.e. focus on import words for summary.
3. Decoder: Generate summary.

Experiments:
5 encoder layers, using the first 120 words from article to ~10 words summary.
Word embbeding size is 128. Hidden units 256. 200k vocabulary size. 4k sampled softmax.
